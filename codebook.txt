The dataset resulting from cleaning and reshaping performed in run_analysis.R is located in the file "tidy.txt"

The variables contained and their respective values are as follows: 

subjectID: The subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

activityname: Refers to what activity subject was peforming while measurements were taken. Its levels are: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

Measurement: The description of measurement taken - can assume the following values: 
fBodyAcc-mean()-X           fBodyAcc-mean()-Y           fBodyAcc-mean()-Z           fBodyAcc-std()-X
